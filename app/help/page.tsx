    question: "Why do I need to enter a primary aspiration first?",

      "Because alumni's offerings are organized around career outcomes, and your primary aspiration is the strongest signal of which outcomes you care about. You can update it any time from your profile.",

    question: "What does 'scope check' mean?",
